## Project 1: Game programming and analysis
### Business Case

You are an analyst at a "scrappy" online gaming company that specializes in remakes of last year's fads.

Your boss, who runs the product development team, is convinced that Pokemon Go's fatal flaw was that you had to actually move around outside. She has design mock-ups for a new game called Pokemon Stay: in this version players still need to move, but just from website to website. Pokemon gyms are now popular online destinations, and catching Pokemon in the "wild" simply requires browsing the internet for hours in the comfort of your home.

She wants you to program a prototype version of the game, and analyze the planned content to help the team calibrate the design.

## Project 2: Civic data analyses
### Business Case

Your hometown mayor just created a new data analysis team to give policy advice, and the administration recruited you via LinkedIn to join it. Unfortunately, due to budget constraints, for now the "team" is just you...

The mayor wants to start a new initiative to move the needle on one of two separate issues: high school education outcomes, or drug abuse in the community.

Also unfortunately, that is the entirety of what you've been told. And the mayor just went on a lobbyist-funded fact-finding trip in the Bahamas. In the meantime, you got your hands on two national datasets: one on SAT scores by state, and one on drug use by age. Start exploring these to look for useful patterns and possible hypotheses!

## Project 3: Regression and classification with housing data
### Business Case

You work for a real estate company interested in using data science to determine the best properties to buy and re-sell. Specifically, your company would like to identify the characteristics of residential houses that estimate the sale price and the cost-effectiveness of doing renovations.

There are three components to the project:

1. Estimate the sale price of properties based on their "fixed" characteristics, such as neighborhood, lot size, number of stories, etc.
2. Estimate the value of possible changes and renovations to properties from the variation in sale price not explained by the fixed characteristics. Your goal is to estimate the potential return on investment (and how much you should be willing to pay contractors) when making specific improvements to properties.
3. Determine the features in the housing data that best predict "abnormal" sales (forclosures, etc.).

This project uses the [Ames housing data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) recently made available on Kaggle.

## Project 4: Web Scraping Job Postings
### Business Case Overview

You're working as a data scientist for a contracting firm that's rapidly expanding. Now that they have their most valuable employee (you!), they need to leverage data to win more contracts. Your firm offers technology and scientific solutions and wants to be competitive in the hiring market. Your principal has two main objectives:

1. Determine the industry factors that are most important in predicting the salary amounts for these data.
2. Determine the factors that distinguish job categories and titles from each other. For example, can required skills accurately predict job title?

To limit the scope, your principal has suggested that you focus on data-related job postings, e.g. data scientist, data analyst, research scientist, business intelligence, and any others you might think of. You may also want to decrease the scope by limiting your search to a single region.

Scrape your own data from a job aggregation tool like Indeed.com in order to collect the data to best answer these two questions.
