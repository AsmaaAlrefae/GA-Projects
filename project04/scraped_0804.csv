What is the ideal assortment for a given category which covers all key price-segments, while maximizing revenue?
How do factors like product reviews, delivery lead times, product descriptions affect a product’s purchase potential?


You will have access to cutting edge technology, tools & training from Lazada. You’ll also have daily access to coaching & business expertise from stalwarts of both companies.

At Shift Technology, we are constantly looking for new ways to innovate. Fraud landscapes are in constant motion and in order to ensure our detection methods are always one step ahead, our data scientists must be too.
Shift Technology data scientists are the central productive force of the company. They design the models, construct the features, implement the rules, and optimize the algorithms that are used throughout the data processing pipeline. They face two main challenges: messy and often incomplete data paired with complex and ever-evolving problems.
The data we collect comes in all shapes and sizes and is not, for the most part, quantitative. Insurance claims data typically includes date, location, circumstantial details, damage descriptions, and involved parties. With that wide array of information, our data scientists must be comfortable with a variety of specific approaches: unsupervised anomaly detection, temporal sequences analysis, semantic network analysis …
As for the solution, our data scientists must be able to produce predictions justified with intelligible explanations, even when very little data is available.
Our data scientists have the exciting mission of designing and implementing models that replicate and enhance real-world fraud handling deduction patterns. They are tasked with optimizing the algorithms involved in the data processing pipeline and making adjustments as fraud scenarios mature and evolve.
After a few short months of joining our data scientist team you will be able to:
Understand insurance data and fraud mechanisms;
Create the associated mathematical models;
Implement, test and optimize the associated algorithms;
Participate in workshops with the clients to gather feedback and integrate it to the models;
Continuously provide ideas to improve the solution.Your toolkit

Researchers from Technical University Munich and Nanyang Technological University join forces and are funded by Singapore’s National Research Foundation as part of the Campus for Research Excellence And Technological Enterprise (CREATE).


TUMCREATE is made up of over 100 scientists, researchers and engineers led by Professors from the Technical University of Munich and Nanyang Technological University. The Mission of TUM CREATE is to seek the ultimate public transport system for the people of Singapore. Our innovative road transport solutions will provide high comfort and a positive travel experience, best protection of the environment and maximum benefit to the society and the economy.


More information about TUMCREATE can be found by viewing our web pages at http://www.tum-create.edu.sg/


About this Position


TUMCREATE is researching into the Ultimate Public Transport System (UPTS) for Singapore based on autonomous mobility and enabling infrastructure. Large-scale computer simulations are employed in order to design and evaluate the envisioned transport system. To counter the enormous runtimes of large simulations, each simulation run is parallelized across a number of interconnected execution nodes. However, after parallelization, communication over a network is required to reflect the interactions within the simulation, instead of the local memory accesses in a sequential simulation. If detailed information about the memory accesses in the simulator were available prior to parallelization, the simulation could be partitioned in a way that minimizes network traffic and thus decreases the simulation runtime.


The goal of the Master’s thesis is to create a tool to characterize the memory accesses within an existing traffic simulator. The tool will generate graphs that show the amount of data accessed across class boundaries in a C++- based simulator. Existing memory profiling tools such as valgrind will be applied and extended to identify the source code locations associated with memory accesses and thus to provide the basis for determining source and destination classes of memory accesses.


Requirements

Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science or similar
Strong programming skills in C or C++
Good understanding of operating system concepts such as system calls and virtual memory
Experience with profiling and debugging tools
Proficiency in at least one scripting language (e.g., Perl or Python).
Ability to work independently
Motivation to learn new topics
Good communication skills

Job Position


The Singapore University of Technology and Design along with Massachusetts Institute of Design is hiring for a data-analytics, developer, &/or research role. The roles offered are related to investigation, implementation, and analysis for a new research project awarded by the International Design Centre Singapore, initially a two-year program.


Project Description


This project focuses on if data-visualisation for use in a design context, could be best tackled from a 'decision first' point of view. Developing design approaches and tools for industry which support the act of decision making. This is in contrast to a 'data first' approach where the visualisations used are dictated by the most appropriate way to show the data but what is done with that data is ignored. The hypnosis is that actionable data-visualisation is inherently different and requires research to improve it as well as new interaction platforms to support good approaches.


The research is interdisciplinary anchored in Architecture, Structural Engineering and Geography/Planning domains by, Sam Joyce [SUTD] (principal investigator), Caitlin Muller [MIT], and Ate Poorthuis [SUTD] respectively all with industry, software and research experience. The spatial, visual, analytical and subjective nature of these disciplines makes them uniquely interesting when considering how design decisions are made. Typically, with buildings, masterplans, and government initiatives there are a complex set of stakeholders with executive power. This project aims to research and consider what types of visualisations are required to provide the best insight to help these people make these decisions.


Job Description


We are keen to take on someone who is enthusiastic about design and data visualisation. The role aims to give a motivated self-starter the space and support to explore new concepts systems and implantations, guided within a group of domain experts with strong academic and industrial backgrounds. The SUTD environment is new and well suited to those with initiative both professionally and socially.


The role is flexible and could cove one or more of the below topics;

Developing web-systems for gathering research data on professional decision making via interactive highly visual web-apps. Ideally this would include both frontend with experience in relevant dynamic frameworks, also back end specifically node.js servers and basic MongoDB interop.
Experimental data analytics, visualisation and modelling. The project will be conducting interactive experiments on a wide range of already committed industry leaders, design students, and the general public via interactive platforms to gain first hand data to provide insights into the process. The role will involve design and implementation of the experiments and subsequent analysis and exposition. Ensuring analytics rigor but also uncovering trends and relationships.
Development of webserver services to aid designers on decision making based on the recommendations in the initial research. This may involve a full user system but also a web framework to help designers easily implement these approaches into their workflows.
The job will be based in SUTD, with planned exchanges and openings to visit to work at MIT. Project researchers from MIT will visit and work collaboratively at SUTD. Furthermore, opportunities will be made to present and share the work at conferences based on research outcomes.

About EDB


The Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB), a government agency under the Ministry of Trade and Industry, is responsible for strategies that enhance Singapore’s position as a global centre for business, innovation, and talent. We undertake investment promotion and industry development, and work with international businesses, both foreign and local, by providing information, connection to partners and access to government incentives for their investments. Our mission is to create sustainable economic growth, with vibrant business and good job opportunities for Singapore.

About Infocomms & Media Division


Jobs. UI/UX designer at Accenture, software developer at Google, data scientist at IBM - Singaporeans. Have you ever wondered how we got here? Why do global heavyweights invest here, and why do they believe they can rely on Singapore to push the next frontier in Asia? Jobs matter. Good jobs help people achieve their dreams. They give people a way to learn, grow, and contribute to society and feel a sense of significance.


Our job is to create these jobs. We inspire companies to dream and design their futures in Asia, and in the process, create jobs Singaporeans aspire towards. At Infocooms & Media (ICM), we believe that Singapore is well-positioned to be the digital capital of Asia. And we help the internet titans, media conglomerates, and software innovators of the world see what we see.


Role of an ICM Officer


As ICM officers, we interact with business leaders to understand how Singapore's vision and efforts can complement their strategies in Asia. We also partner with other government agencies to ensure that Singapore's digital economy has the necessary resources to be globally competitive. To do this, our team needs three kinds of people. Which one are you?


Team ICM needs you!


Archetypes


The Pathfinder


The Connector


The Hustler


In the land of the blind, the one-eyed jack is king. In the fast-moving tech industry, Singapore needs to constantly stay a step ahead. The Pathfinder is a strategist who sees opportunity where others only see chaos. She has a point-of-view and energizes the team with a vision that propels it to action. The pathfinder is intellectually curious and finds patterns in her day-to-day engagements with potential investors and conversations with thought leaders at industry events.


Industry development is a long-term game. Bulldozing through others for short-term gain is winning the battle but losing the war. Our role as Singapore’s industry developers puts us squarely in-between the rest of government and industry players in the private sector. The connector adeptly balances the interests of multiple stakeholders while pursuing our vision for economic growth and job creation in Singapore. The connector has a sense for each person's motivations & objectives and is energized by the challenge of winning others over.


The only way to avoid making mistakes is not to do anything, and that would be the ultimate mistake. A large part of EDB's work requires project management. In the face of complex situations, the hustler is a conductor who enjoys putting parts into motion, staying flexible and challenging norms. He has a holy discontent that motivates him & his team to excellence and sets the pace to keep things moving. His enthusiasm is contagious.


A Day in the Life


Leo - Lead at Infocomms & Media (2 years)


What are your responsibilities?


I manage a portfolio of accounts in the tech & media sector. These are multinational companies seeking to invest or deepen their investments in Singapore. I work with my colleagues to develop a roadmap for our sector and translate this into company engagement strategies, identifying select capabilities that are important to Singapore's economy. I then work with my companies to execute these ideas and achieve win-win outcomes for them and for Singapore.


What was your most memorable day at work?


Every day is a different day. Yesterday, I finally closed a deal with executives from a leading American multinational to anchor a blockchain R&D team in Singapore. This came after weeks of complex negotiations with the company and discussions with our colleagues at JTC and IMDA.


Most memorable moment - there was one time I was invited to give a presentation on Singapore’s growth at an event. I found out on the day-of that I was the keynote speaker to a crowd of about 100 VPs and Heads of various business departments. To add to the pressure, I was asked to sit on a panel discussion to represent EDB for a forty-minute Q&A. I took the proverbial advice to visualize all of them naked (wouldn’t recommend), and started speaking. Somehow, the message seemed to resonate with them. I realized that what I had on my side was the truth of what Singapore has achieved. No matter how timidly or confidently the message was delivered, the facts speak for themselves. Singapore is a good place to invest.


How have you grown at EDB?


All my memorable moments so far tend to be the highly uncomfortable ones that stretched and challenged me. For example, on my very first business trip accompanying my Director, EDB threw me into 19 meetings over 5 days in 5 cities, a flight every day. London, Helsinki, Berlin, Amsterdam, Paris. Those 5 days alone were like an MBA - I learned about corporate strategy, business models, negotiations, and the art of influence.


What do you enjoy most about EDB?


EDB attracts a unique subset of people. These are ambitious, creative, highly competent individuals who could easily make it (and earn much, much more) in the private sector. So why do they choose to stay at EDB? They do it because they want to feel and see the impact they make on Singaporeans’ lives. I’ve noticed this about them. They are here because they choose to be – often because they have been blessed by the opportunities Singapore has created for them and because they want to pay it forward. This combination of personal drive and service to a greater good uniquely defines EDB.


To meet the challenges of this role, you must have/be:

Degree holder in, but not limited to Engineering, Computer Science or Economics,
At least 4 years of relevant work experience for the Assistant Head position
Keen interest in the Infocomms & Media industry with a strong desire to learn about and understand technological trends that influence the industry
Strong conceptual & analytical thinking skills

We invite you to be part of our ambitious, close-knit team creating systems for large customers who need to crunch through Tbps of data in real-time. Our approach is relentless performance-oriented software engineering vs. server sprawl in our customers' datacenters.


You will use the latest high-end hardware and continuously devise ways to push the envelope of software performance.


We build in-house systems if we must. We had to for indexing 1M 60-column rows/s, for aggregating high throughput event streams over hundreds of combinations of dimensions, and for pattern matching 5M patterns at 100Gb/s per 2RU. We use these to solve real customer problems.


You will experiment wildly. For example we implemented network monitoring using a GPU, and we tested 4-socket machines with 2T RAM. Our current favorite platform is a 2-socket system with E5-2699v4 CPUs (88 lcores in total), 4x40Gbps NICs and 1T RAM, which we use to process 160Gbps.


You will help us build a successful software platform for the long run. We invest a lot in flexibility, such as with our extensible rule engine and declarative aggregation system that empowers our analysts and helps us minimise the C code we have to write for supporting disparate use-cases.


We know the devil is in the details. You will improve performance through better memory allocation systems and better data structures, all while ensuring that they are integrated with Address Sanitizer and fully tested using unit tests and end-to-end regression tests.


We work end-to-end. You will implement data engineering solutions that are both efficient and secure for handling events from 500 million users, and to extract insight without leaking individual information.

Whilst we waited for flying cars, the 4th industrial revolution began. This will fundamentally change the nature of work at every company. Taiger is leading this transformation and clients that work with us are at the frontier. We deliver revolutionary results by helping clients replace ‘knowledge workers’ with a more reliable, Artificial Intelligence powered virtual workforce within all of their processes.

Taiger is a global leader in cognitive automation for financial enterprises and governments, present on four continents. We build digital machines that are faster, better and cheaper than humans in certain work functions, or make humans vastly more productive in others. These are big, difficult problems which require equally audacious technical solutions.

Traditional structured data is only a fraction of an organisation’s information; the vast majority of information is unstructured content: documents, reports, emails, survey forms, voice calls etc. Traditional machine learning approaches alone cannot solve for unstructured information. This requires something much more special.

Taiger fundamentally solves unstructured information access problems and transforms mere information into executable knowledge. Our product portfolio is based on a state-of-the-art AI solution architecture for reuse and agile integration.

Taiger has a deep expertise in combining 5 of the 7 forms of AI to help make financial institutions profitable again. This is technically achieved through the application of semantic and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, knowledge representation, perception and concept-extraction and multi-language ontology building skills, which no other product provider offers.

We undertake cutting edge research and apply the latest technical innovations to solve real problems.

You should genuinely be excited by an unstructured, fast moving startup environment where your contribution matters. We are building a culture and team with those that are generally excited about the technology we are building and the problems we're solving. Joining a growing team where your responsibilities have a real potential to expand in scale and scope should be a compelling proposition to you.

SUMMARY

Taiger seeks Front End Engineers to join our engineering team and help us design and implement highly performing software. Successful candidates have a proven track record developing software for the Web and hold a BsC, MsC or PhD in computer science, engineering or related field.

As a Front-End Engineer in Taiger you will contribute to the development of innovative products, based on state-of-the-art technologies, and able to make a significant impact in the industry.
